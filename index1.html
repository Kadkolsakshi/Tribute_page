                        Inspired by the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, Shri Modi has ushered in a paradigm 
                        shift in governance that has led to inclusive, development-oriented and corruption-free governance. 
                        The Prime Minister has worked with speed and scale to realise the aim of Antyodaya, or ensuring last-mile delivery of schemes and services.

                        Today, India is home to the world’s largest healthcare programme, Ayushman Bharat. Covering over 50 crore 
                        Indians, Ayushman Bharat provides top quality and affordable healthcare to the poor and neo-middle class.

                        The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, launched in 2016 provides free cooking gas connections to the poor. 
                        It has proven to be a major game-changer in providing smoke-free kitchens to over 7 crore beneficiaries, 
                        most of whom are women.

                        Going a step ahead of climate change, PM Modi has talked about climate justice. In 2018, Heads of State and Government from several nations came to India 
                        for the launch of the International Solar Alliance, an innovative effort to harness solar energy for a better planet.

                        Beyond politics, Narendra Modi enjoys writing. He has authored several books, including poetry. He begins 
                        his day with Yoga, which strengthens his body and mind and instills the power of calmness in an otherwise fast-paced routine.
